# Latitude Analysis Dashboard

In this project I created a dashboard website using visualizations from a prior project. Specifically, weather data.

In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot and a means by which you can navigate between them. The pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. I've also created a landing page, a page where you can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where you can view the data used to build them.
